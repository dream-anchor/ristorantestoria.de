      faq1Question: "What makes Neapolitan pizza so special?",
      faq1Answer: "Neapolitan pizza is characterized by three things: (1) Long dough fermentation (at least 24 hours), (2) Baking in a stone oven at over 400°C in just 90 seconds, (3) Premium ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes DOP and buffalo mozzarella from Campania.",
      faq2Question: "Where to find the best Neapolitan pizza in Munich?",
      faq2Answer: "At Ristorante STORIA Munich Maxvorstadt, we bake our pizzas in traditional Neapolitan style: 24-hour dough fermentation, stone oven at 400°C, San Marzano tomatoes DOP and buffalo mozzarella from Campania. Just 5 minutes from Königsplatz.",
      faq3Question: "How much does a pizza cost at STORIA Munich?",
      faq3Answer: "Our pizzas cost between € 9.90 (Pizza Marinara) and € 24.90 (Pizza Tartufo with black truffle). The classic Pizza Margherita costs € 12.50, the popular Pizza Bufalina with buffalo mozzarella € 16.50.",
